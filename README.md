## Running the project
This project can be run in the browser by cloning the Github project or by downloading the zipped folder. The preprocessed data is uploaded as part of the project. The Python files for preprocessing are also included, but the corpora should be downloaded separately.

By using the project folder as the root folder and running a server (for example: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`), the visualizations should be visible on [localhost](http://localhost:8000/).
